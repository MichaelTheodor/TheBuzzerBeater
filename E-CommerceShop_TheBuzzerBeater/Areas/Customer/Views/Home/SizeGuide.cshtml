    Waist: Measure around your natural waistline, where your torso bends when you lean to the side.
    Hip: Measure around the fullest part of your hips, keeping the tape parallel to the ground.
    Foot Length: Measure the length of your foot from the back of your heel to the tip of your longest toe.
    Additional Tips

    If you fall between sizes, we recommend sizing up for a looser fit or sizing down for a tighter fit, depending on your preference.
    Keep in mind that different brands and styles may have slight variations in sizing, so always refer to the specific size chart provided for each product.
